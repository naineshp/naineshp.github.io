    <p> As part of my degree I carried out an investigation into chaos in a pendulum. 
    Within this project the simple pendulum, the double pendulum and the inverted 
    pendulum was investigated, with a different approach required for each. 
    Initially we look at simple linear models with analytical solutions but quickly 
    move onto developing nonlinear models which are solved using computer programs 
    such as Maple and Matlab. The ODE’s derived consider resistive parameters, and 
    general amplitude approximations. A simple pendulum model is adapted to consider 
    the double pendulum and investigate, in detail, how the initial conditions have 
    a significant impact on the future motion of the pendulum giving us the evidence 
    of chaotic behaviour. Finally, we go on to consider the inverted pendulum, deriving
    governing equations for the motion that can be written in the form of Mathieu’s 
    equations and subsequently look into the stability regions. An interesting 
    phenomenon is where a pendulum that hangs vertically downwards can be inverted
    by simply oscillating its pivot point at a specific drive frequency and drive 
    amplitude. This work extends an investigation into solutions for the case of an
    inverted pendulum obtained by Acheson, D.J. 1999 From Calculus to Chaos.   </p>
