	<p>	Simple file modeling in an aero engine bearing chamber  </p>
	
	</ul>
	
	<ul class="row1">
    <p> The investigation that was carried out as part of my masters thesis 
    presents a mathematical model for the prediction of oil behaviour inside an 
    aero-engine bearing chamber. 
    The investigation is carried out from when oil is injected into the chamber, 
    is collected as a thin film on the chamber walls, to when it is removed via a sump. 
    A numerical model is derived, developed, and evaluated. The model predicts the fluid 
    height, velocity, and temperature of the oil film, by solving a coupled boundary 
    value problem using MATLAB. This model includes the effects of gravity, viscosity, 
    thermal conductivity, wall and surface shear stresses, oil impact, heat transfer to 
    the oil from the chamber walls and core airflow, together with injection 
    characteristics of droplets including their volume flux, velocity and temperature. 
    Initially governing equations are derived for a bearing chamber model informed 
    by thin film models from a previous research paper. Developments of the dynamic 
    model allow for the inclusion of distributed mass fluxes, and the introduction of 
    the energy equation, allowing for analysis of the film temperature. Encouraging 
    results are provided to explore the film behaviour for a range of parameter choices, 
    and evaluation is considered of the physical relevance to an aero-engine bearing 
    chamber. Outcomes include the existence of steady thin film solutions for limited 
    values of key parameters due to physical solutions being either unsteady or not 
    capable of maintaining a coherent film. Operational conditions are also considered 
    such as the effects of increased flux of cool droplets the overall film temperature 
    would decrease and results have shown that this is the case. It is also noted that 
    if the mass flux exceeds a critical value then counter intuitively the film 
    temperature increases due to the film thickness thinning at the wall.
