    <p> A work in progress project I have been working on involves building a metal 
    polyhedral sculpture. Namely the Great Dirhombicosidodecahedron.  </p>
	</ul>


	<ul class="row1">
    <p> The Great Dirhombicosidodecahedron is a complex shape with 60 vertices, 240 
    edges and 124 faces. Below is a diagram of the polyhedra. The challenge is to build 
    one out of magnetic ball bearings and metal rods which would snap onto the metal ball 
    bearings.         </p>

    <p> This may seem like a simple project, but there are a number of difficulties that 
    have been faced; firstly the model is described as having 60 vertices and 240 edges, 
    which can be decomposed into 40 equilateral triangles, 60 squares and 24 regular 
    pentagons. When they are put together there are many intersecting edges which add to 
    the complexity. A program was written to find the locations of each intersecting 
    point and the length of each edge. The program revealed that 930 ball bearings would 
    be required and 2160 individual rods would have to be cut.  </p>

    <p> The following picture shows the polyhedra with a sphere inside, the shape is 
    such that there are no intersecting points that lie on the inside of the sphere.  </p>

    <ul class="row1">
    <p> Details of how to fabricate the polyhedra have been made. However, Initial 
    testing to make the polyhedra have shown that the construction would be too 
    complicated and expensive to carry out right now. For the interested reader a 
    spreadsheet with the calculations that have been made are given.  </p>
